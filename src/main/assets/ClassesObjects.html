  Classes are user-defined data types which contains data-members and methods in it.
  Objects are the instance of class which holds the allocated memory for variables and methods in class.<br>
  An object’s data and methods can be accessed through the dot (.) operator via the
object’s reference variable.<br><br>
A class is essentially a programmer-defined type. A class is a reference type, which means
that a variable of the class type can reference an instance of the class. The following statement
declares the variable myStudent to be of the Student type:<br><br>
Student myStudent;<br><br>
The variable myStudent can reference a Student object. The next statement creates an object
and assigns its reference to myStudent:<br><br>
myStudent = new Student();<br><br>
You can write a single statement that combines the declaration of an object reference variable,
the creation of an object, and the assigning of an object reference to the variable with the following
syntax:<br><br>
ClassName object = new ClassName();<br><br>
