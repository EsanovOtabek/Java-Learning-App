  Methods can be used to define reusable code and organize and simplify code.<br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">Defining a method</font></b><br>
  A method definition consists of its method name, parameters, return value type, and body.
The syntax for defining a method is:<br><br>
modifier returnValueType methodName(list of parameters) {<br>
// Method body;<br>
}<br><br>
The method header specifies the modifiers, return value type, method name, and
parameters of the method.A method may return a value. The returnValueType is the data type of the value the
method returns.If a method returns a value, it is called a valuereturning
method, otherwise it is called a void method.
The variables defined in the method header are known as formal parameters or simply
parameters. A parameter is like a placeholder: When a method is invoked, you pass a value to
the parameter. This value is referred to as an actual parameter or argument. The parameter
list refers to the method’s type, order, and number of the parameters. The method name and
the parameter list together constitute the method signature.<br><br>
<b><font color="#ff0000">Calling a method</font></b><br>
Calling a method executes the code in the method.
In a method definition, you define what the method is to do. To execute the method, you have
to call or invoke it.
If a method returns a value, a call to the method is usually treated as a value. For example,<br>
int larger = max(3, 4);<br>
calls max(3, 4) and assigns the result of the method to the variable larger.<br>
This program contains the main method and the max method. The main method is just like
any other method except that it is invoked by the JVM to start the program.
The main method’s header is always the same. Like the one in this example, it includes the
modifiers public and static, return value type void, method name main, and a parameter
of the String[] type. String[] indicates that the parameter is an array of String<br><br>
<b><font color="#ff0000">Passing parameters</font></b><br>
The arguments are passed by value to parameters when invoking a method.
The power of a method is its ability to work with parameters. You can use println to print
any string and max to find the maximum of any two int values. When calling a method, you
need to provide arguments, which must be given in the same order as their respective parameters
in the method signature. This is known as parameter order association. For example, the
following method prints a message n times:<br><br>
public static void myMethod(String m, int n) {<br>
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)<br>
System.out.println(m);<br>
}<br>
