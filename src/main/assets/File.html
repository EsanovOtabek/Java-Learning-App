  The java.io package contains all the classes required for performing file operations.This happens
  by stream.A stream is a sequence of data.We have output,input and error stream in java.<br>
  Java uses outputstream for writing the data in the file and inputstream for reading the content of the file.
  Stream is nothing but a connection.<br><br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">OutputStream</font></b><br><br>
  outputstream class is an abstract class and had some following methods:<br>
  1. public void write(int) throws IOException - it writes the byte to current outputstream<br>
  2. public void write(byte[]) throws IOException - it writes the array of bytes to current outputstream<br>
  3. public void flush() throws IOException - flushes the output stream<br>
  4. public void close() throws IOException - closes the outputstream<br><br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">InputStream</font></b><br><br>
  inputstream class is also an abstract class and had some following methods:<br>
  1. public abstract int read() throws IOException - reads the next byte from inputstream<br>
  2. public int available() throws IOException - returns the number of bytes available in stream<br>
  3. public void close() throws IOException - closes the input stream<br><br>
  Syntax for getting connection (stream) with a file is as follows:<br><br>
  FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("file_location");<br>
  FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("file_location");<br>
  You will understand it better when will see its program.<br><br>
