  A loop can be used to tell a program to execute statements repeatedly.<br><br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">1. While Loop</font></b><br>
  A while loop executes statements repeatedly while the condition is true.The syntax for the while loop is:<br>
  while (loop-condition) {<br>
  Statement(s);<br>
  }<br>
  The part of the loop that contains the statements
to be repeated is called the loop body.It contains a loop condition.It is evaluated each
time to determine if the loop body is executed. If its evaluation is true, the loop body is executed;
if its evaluation is false, the entire loop terminates and the program control turns to
the statement that follows the while loop.<br><br>
<b><font color="#ff0000">2. Do-While Loop</font></b><br>
A do-while loop is the same as a while loop except that it executes the loop body
first and then checks the loop continuation condition.
The do-while loop is a variation of the while loop. Its syntax is:<br>
do {<br>
Statement(s);<br>
} while (loop-condition);<br>
The loop body is executed first, and then the loop-condition is evaluated.
If the evaluation is true, the loop body is executed again; if it is false, the do-while
loop terminates.<br><br>
<b><font color="#ff0000">3. For Loop</font></b><br>
A for loop has a concise syntax for writing loops.
In general, the syntax of a for loop is:<br>
for (initial value; loop-condition;
increment/decrement) {<br>
Statement(s);<br>
}<br>
The for loop statement starts with the keyword for, followed by a pair of parentheses
enclosing the control structure of the loop. This structure consists of initial value,
loop-condition, and increment/decrement. The control
structure is followed by the loop body enclosed inside braces. The initial-value, loop
condition, and increment/decrement are separated by
semicolons.
