  Java was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1991 and now it is acquired by Oracle Corporation.Java was developed by Games Gosling and Patrick Naughton.<br>
  The target of Java is to write a program once and then run this program on multiple operating systems.
  Java is Object Oriented language and holds properties of Object Oriented Programming like<br><br>
  1.Encapsulation<br>
  2.Abstraction<br>
  3.Inheritence<br>
  4.Polymorphism<br>
  <br>
  Here are some of the features of Java : <br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">Simple</font></b><br>
  The Java language is easy to learn. Java code is easy to read and write and run on any operating systems.<br><br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">Object Oriented</font></b><br>
  Java has all properties of Object Oriented Technology such as Encapsulation,Abstraction,Inheritence and Polymorphism.<br><br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">Robust and Secure</font></b><br>
  Java is very secure because of its security manager that allows checking at compile time and runtime, you have never heard that java
  application is attacked by virus.It has automatic garbage collection technology which makes it Robust and also it does not have the onloadedmetadata
  concept of pointers like C/C++<br><br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">High Performance</font></b><br>
  Java code is firslty converted to bytecode by JVM which provides strong Performance.<br><br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">Multithreaded</font></b><br>
  It means that we can create applications in java which are multitasking and highly interactive.<br><br>
  <b><font color="#ff0000">Platform Independent</font></b><br>
  Java code is converted to bytecode which can run on any operating systems like Windows,Solaris,Linux and MacOS.
