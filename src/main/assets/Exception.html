  Exception Handling is a powerful mechanism in java for handling the Exception or Errors.It maintained the
  normal flow of the program.There are many types of Exception such as ClassNotFoundException,ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException,
  IOException,SQLException,ArithmeticException etc.Suppose there are 5 instructions in your program and if an error is occur at
  3 then rest of instructions will not be executed, Exception Handling provides solution to this problem.The java.lang.Throwable
  is the root class of Exception and Error.<br>
  There are three types of exception in java :<br>
  1.Checked exception<br>
  2.Unchecked exception<br>
  3.error<br><br>
  1.The class which are from throwable class such as IOException,SQLException are checked at compile time
  are known as checked exception.<br><br>
  2.The exceptions which are found at runtime are known as unchecked exception such as ArithmeticException,
  NullPointerException,ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException etc.<br><br>
  3.These are irrecovarable such as OutOfMemory,StackOverflow etc.<br><br>
  Keywords use for handling the exceptions are:<br><br>
  try - it holds the block of code which can have exception in it.It is followed by
  catch or finally block.<br><br>
  catch - The catch block handle the exception, but it must have a try block.<br><br>
  finally - It is used to execute important block of code in program.<br><br>
  throw - it is used to throw an exception<br><br>
  throws - It  specifies that there may occur exception in the method.<br><br>
  class Main{<br>
    public static void main(String[] args){<br>
      try{<br>
        int a = 10/0;<br>
      }catch(ArithmeticException e){<br>
        System.out.println("error");<br>
      }<br>
    }<br>
  }<br><br>
